# IronSpell Shore Disaster Division Action Plan (Project Management Techniques)
In This Project, Our Group Was Tasked With Creating a Emergency Deployment Team that would assist a public shoreline known as Ironspell Shores in the case that any type of disaster may occur.
I was assigned as project manager and was tasked with delegate documentation to team members, account for budget, and effectively creating a plan for the Disaster Division and Surrounding Emergency Response Personel.
